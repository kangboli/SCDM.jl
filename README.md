# SCDM

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue.svg)](https://scdm.kangbo.dev)

`SCDM.jl` is a package for the selected columns of the density matrix and the
truncated density convolution algorithms based on `WTP.jl`.

This code aims to be fast and robust. It is currently takes about 30x 
less iteration and has 3x the per iteration speed compared to Wannier90.

> The overlap matrix computation does not work for ultrasoft pseudo-potentials, but you can read the `.mmn` file generated by pw2wannier.x

## What is in here

- Implementation of the truncated density convolution (TDC) method. 
- Experimental GPU implementation of TDC. Should work up to 32 bands.
- Selected Columns of the density matrix.

## Installation

Someday these packages will be registered. For now, in Pkg mode

```julia
add https://github.com/kangboli/WTP.jl
add https://github.com/kangboli/SCDM.jl
```

The [test data](https://github.com/kangboli/scdm_dataset) needs to be
separately downloaded into the `test` folder. 

```
cd test
git clone https://github.com/kangboli/scdm_dataset
```
