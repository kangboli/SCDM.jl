# SCDM

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue.svg)](https://scdm.kangbo.dev)

`SCDM.jl` is a package for the selected columns of the density matrix and the
truncated density convolution algorithms based on `WTP.jl`.

> The overlap matrix computation does not work for ultrasoft pseudo-potentials, but you can read the `.mmn` file generated by pw2wannier.x

## What is in here

- Implementation of the truncated density convolution (TDC) method. 
- Experimental GPU implementation of TDC. Should work up to 32 bands.
- Selected Columns of the density matrix.
