     Parallel version (MPI), running on     8 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     K-points division:     npool     =       8
     22567 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts

     Waiting for input...
     Reading input from standard input

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     no reason to have ecutrho>4*ecutwfc
     Message from routine divide_et_impera:
     suboptimal parallelization: some nodes have no k-points

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
